## Step 1: Download MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51
 
You can download MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51 from the official MySQL website[^1^]. There are different versions of the driver for different operating systems and architectures. Choose the one that matches your system requirements and download it to your local machine.
 
## Step 2: Install MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51
 
The installation process may vary depending on your operating system and the type of package you downloaded. Here are some general steps to follow:
 
- If you downloaded an MSI installer, double-click on it and follow the instructions on the screen.
- If you downloaded a ZIP archive, extract it to a folder of your choice and run the setup.exe file inside it.
- If you downloaded a source package, you will need to compile it using CMake and Visual Studio or GCC. You can find more details on how to do this in the README.md file[^2^] inside the package.

## Step 3: Configure MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51
 
After installing MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51, you will need to configure it to connect to your MySQL Server. You can do this using the ODBC Data Source Administrator tool that comes with your operating system or using a third-party tool like MySQL Workbench. Here are some general steps to follow:

- Open the ODBC Data Source Administrator tool and click on the Add button.
- Select MySQL ODBC 3.51 Driver from the list of available drivers and click on Finish.
- Enter a name and a description for your data source and specify the parameters for connecting to your MySQL Server, such as host name, port number, user name, password, and database name.
- Click on Test to verify that the connection works and click on OK to save your data source.

## Step 4: Use MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51
 
Now that you have installed and configured MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51, you can use it to access your MySQL data from any ODBC-aware application. For example, you can use Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access, Crystal Reports, or any other application that supports ODBC to query and manipulate your data. You can also use SQL statements or stored procedures to perform more complex operations.
 
## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to download and install MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51 on your system and how to configure it to connect to your MySQL Server. We hope this article was helpful and informative for you. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to contact us.

## How to Use Stored Procedures with MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51
 
Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements that are stored on the MySQL Server and can be executed by name. They can improve the performance and security of your applications by reducing the network traffic and preventing SQL injection attacks. In this section, we will show you how to use stored procedures with MySQL Connector/ODBC 3.51.
 
### Creating Stored Procedures
 
To create a stored procedure, you need to use the CREATE PROCEDURE statement in MySQL. For example, the following statement creates a stored procedure named sp\_add that takes two parameters and returns their sum:
 `

DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE sp_add(IN a INT, IN b INT, OUT c INT)
BEGIN
  SET c = a + b;
END //
DELIMITER ;

` 
You can execute this statement in MySQL Workbench or any other MySQL client tool. You can also create stored procedures using ODBC by calling the SQLExecDirect function with the CREATE PROCEDURE statement as the argument.
 
### Calling Stored Procedures
 
To call a stored procedure, you need to use the CALL statement in MySQL. For example, the following statement calls the sp\_add stored procedure with 10 and 20 as the input parameters and stores the output parameter in a variable named @result:
 `

CALL sp_add(10, 20, @result);
SELECT @result;

` 
You can execute this statement in MySQL Workbench or any other MySQL client tool. You can also call stored procedures using ODBC by calling the SQLExecDirect function with the CALL statement as the argument.
 
### Using Parameters
 
To use parameters with stored procedures, you need to use the SQLBindParameter function in ODBC. This function binds a C variable to a parameter marker in an SQL statement. For example, the following code snippet shows how to bind three C variables to the parameters of the sp\_add stored procedure:
 `

SQLHSTMT hstmt; // ODBC statement handle
SQLINTEGER a = 10; // input parameter
SQLINTEGER b = 20; // input parameter
SQLINTEGER c; // output parameter
SQLLEN cbA = 0; // length indicator for a
SQLLEN cbB = 0; // length indicator for b
SQLLEN cbC = 0; // length indicator for c

// Allocate an ODBC statement handle
SQLAllocHandle(SQL_HANDLE_STMT, hdbc, &hstmt);

// Bind the parameters
SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 1, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_LONG, SQL_INTEGER, 0, 0, &a, 0, &cbA);
SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 2, SQL_PARAM_INPUT, SQL_C_LONG, SQL_INTEGER, 0, 0, &b, 0, &cbB);
SQLBindParameter(hstmt, 3, SQL_PARAM_OUTPUT, SQL_C_LONG, SQL_INTEGER, 0, 0, &c, 0, &cbC);

// Execute the stored procedure
SQLExecDirect(hstmt, "CALL sp_add(?, ?, ?)", SQL_NTS);

// Fetch the output parameter
SQLFetch(hstmt);

// Print the result
printf("The sum is %d\n", c);

// Free the ODBC statement handle
SQLFreeHandle(SQL_HANDLE_STMT, hstmt);

` 
This code snippet assumes that you have already allocated and connected an ODBC connection handle named hdbc. You can find more details on how to do this in the previous section.
